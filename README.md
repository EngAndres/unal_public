# Professor's Academic Repository - Universidad Nacional de Colombia

Welcome to the academic repository for Object-Oriented Programming and Software Engineering courses.

## üë®‚Äçüè´ About the Professor

This repository contains course materials, resources, and examples for students enrolled in my classes at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. As a professor dedicated to teaching modern software development practices, I aim to provide comprehensive resources that bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications.

## üìö Courses

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a fundamental paradigm in modern software development. This course covers:

- **Core Concepts**:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
  
- **Key Topics**:
  - Design principles (SOLID)
  - Class relationships and UML diagrams
  - Exception handling
  - Generic programming
  - Best practices in OOP design

- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Understand the principles of object-oriented design
  - Apply OOP concepts to solve real-world problems
  - Write maintainable and reusable code
  - Master object-oriented design patterns

### Software Engineering

Software Engineering focuses on the systematic approach to developing large-scale software systems. This course explores:

- **Core Topics**:
  - Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
  - Requirements analysis and specification
  - Software design and architecture
  - Testing strategies and quality assurance
  - Project management and Agile methodologies
  
- **Key Areas**:
  - Version control systems (Git)
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
  - Software design patterns
  - Code review and refactoring
  - Documentation and maintenance

- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Apply software engineering principles to real projects
  - Work effectively in development teams
  - Understand and implement modern development practices
  - Deliver quality software solutions
